	<h2>Hello, and welcome to my website. My names Gavin Edwards.</h2>
	<p>This website is primarily my portfolio, but there is a bit more as well.</p>
	<p>The About tab goes into details about me and the Portfolio tab shows off some of the things I've done.</p>
	<p>If your curious about specific languages and the like the Tags section will provide you with a more narrow and focused list of projects.</p>
