For COMP 3160 I took the playground game Hunter and created a version that uses your phone GPS & The Google Maps API to be able to play over larger areas..

## What I Did

1. **Created Non-Gameplay Scenes**: Created the landing scene, host scene, join scene, as well as the lobby scene.

2. **Created the Gamplay Scenes**: I created the starting scene, the taf scene, as well as the core gameplay scene.

3. **Created a Firebase**: Linked the whole Application to a temporary set up of a Firebase for the lobbies.

## Final Result
