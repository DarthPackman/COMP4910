**Cloudy** was developed during the **Global Game Jam 2022**, directly responding to the theme of **Duality**. The game features a scientist navigating between contrasting environmental states—**calm and stormy**—in pursuit of a malfunctioning weather AI. This 48-hour project was a focused exercise in implementing responsive physics and rapid prototyping in **Unity**.

## Core Technical Implementation

1. **Physics-Driven Character Control**: Implemented responsive character movement and platform interaction using **Unity's Rigidbody physics system** and **Colliders** in C#. This provided stable and predictable handling for the player character in a dynamically changing world.
2. **Designed Duality Mechanics**: Developed systems intended to represent the "Calm" and "Stormy" duality by altering the primary platform mechanics. This included custom logic to handle two contrasting cloud pivot dynamics (platforms alternating between up/down and left/right movement).
3. **Planned Dynamic Airflow System**: Outlined the core logic for the planned airflow system: a **forward-gusting wind breeze** during calm states, and a powerful **upward gust** during stormy states. This demonstrates the intent to directly tie player movement and challenge to the environment's state.
4. **Efficient Game Jam Execution**: Successfully prototyped and developed the core game loop within the strict time constraints, showcasing the ability to focus on essential features and quickly implement complex physics interactions.

## Final Result & Takeaways

*Cloudy* successfully delivered a functional platforming experience that directly addressed the Jam theme. It stands as a strong example of my ability to rapidly develop physics-based gameplay, structure a project for future expansion, and publish a product under extreme deadlines.
