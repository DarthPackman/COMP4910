**Cloudy** was developed during the Global Game Jam in Winter 2022. It features a scientist chasing a malfunctioning weather AI through stormy skies and serene clouds.

## What I Did

1. Designed levels with alternating weather mechanics.
2. Implemented weather-based platforming mechanics in Unity.
3. Created engaging environments using storm and calm weather effects.

## Final Result

You can view the game on [Itch.io](https://darthpackman.itch.io/cloudy).
