For the Global Game Jam my team and I created a very basic platformer called cloudy where when you switch modes the cloud float different directions.

## What I Did

1. **Created Game in Visual Code - Bolt**: Since we were just learning we created this game using Unity Bolt.

## Final Result

You can view the game <a href="https://darthpackman.itch.io/cloudy" target="_blank">here.</a>
