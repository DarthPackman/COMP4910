**Deep Salvage** was a successful survival project developed during the **Global Game Jam 2025**, directly responding to the theme **"Bubbles."** The narrative centers on a diver whose ship has crashed, forcing them to brave the ocean depths to recover broken engine pieces. This 48-hour challenge was an intense exercise in developing core physics and **resource management systems** in Unity.

## Core Technical and Design Implementation

1.  **Physics-Based Resource Management**: The core mechanic is **air management**, integrated directly with the "Bubbles" theme. Players must conserve and collect bubbles to replenish their oxygen supply, adding a critical survival constraint to exploration.
2.  **Unity/C# Development**: Built entirely in **Unity** and **C#**, the project required the rapid implementation of 2D physics for underwater movement, buoyancy simulation, and collision detection to govern the player's interaction with the environment and obstacles.
3.  **Hazardous Obstacle System**: Designed a functional system for underwater obstacles and hazards. The player is consistently challenged to avoid environmental dangers while searching for the necessary **broken engine pieces** needed to achieve the win condition.
4.  **Game Jam Achievement**: Successfully scoped and delivered a complete gameplay loop—from ship crash narrative setup to item collection and final escape—within the strict 48-hour development window, demonstrating high proficiency in rapid prototyping.

## Final Result & Takeaways

*Deep Salvage* is a strong showcase of foundational game development skills, proving the ability to integrate a specific thematic constraint (Bubbles) into a compelling, functional core mechanic (Air Management) under extreme time pressure.
