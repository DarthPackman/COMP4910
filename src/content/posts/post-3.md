For COMP 2160, I developed **Handshake Murder**, a unique mobile game concept centered on identifying and eliminating your target with handshakes.

## What I Did

1. Programmed gameplay mechanics in Android Studio.
2. Designed UI for interactive play.
3. Ensured gameplay functionality across devices.

## Final Result
