For COMP 2160 I took the traditional theatre game Handshake Murder and created a version of it for Android phones that takes care of all the prep work and uses NFC for the handshakes.

## What I Did

1. **Created Non-Gameplay Scenes**: Created the landing scene, host scene, join scene, as well as the lobby scene.

2. **Created the Gamplay Scenes**: I created the starting scene, the voting scene, as well as the core gameplay scene.

3. **Created a Firebase**: Linked the whole Application to a temporary set up of a Firebase for the lobbies.

## Final Result
