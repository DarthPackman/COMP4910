**Crisis Of Transparency** was a major Computing Science capstone project (COMP 4910) commissioned by the TRU Faculty of Law. The primary goal was to create a modern, interactive, and highly engaging web platform to report on the systemic failures of Canada's **Access to Information** laws, targeting key recommendations for reform.

## Core Technical & Content Implementation

1.  [cite_start]**Modern Frontend Architecture**: The site was built using the **Astro JavaScript web framework**, optimizing it for building a fast, content-driven site by leveraging its **Server-First** approach and minimizing JavaScript overhead[cite: 4260].
2.  **Seamless Content Delivery (Parallax)**: Implemented the entire website as a **single, massive parallax scrolling object**. [cite_start]This design choice enforced a non-interactive, seamless flow [cite: 4236, 4252, 4253] [cite_start]that guides the user through the 66 "pages" of content and embedded videos in less than **15 minutes**[cite: 4234, 4240].
3.  [cite_start]**Component-Based Development**: Leveraged Astro's compatibility with **React components** (e.g., `ParallaxContent.jsx`, `TypeWriter.jsx`) and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, component-based development, ensuring modularity and responsive design[cite: 4309, 4310].
4.  [cite_start]**Client-Driven Requirements**: Successfully executed all requirements from the client (TRU Faculty of Law), including device adaptability and ensuring all content was concise and supported by contextual snippets[cite: 4227, 4231].

## Final Result

The final project is a highly effective advocacy tool that demonstrates expert proficiency in modern, content-focused web development stacks (Astro, React, Tailwind). It showcases the ability to execute large-scale, client-driven projects with a unique technical implementation designed specifically to enhance user engagement.
