This project explores behavioral-based authentication and anomaly detection to enhance website security without explicit user permission.

## What I Did

1. Tracked behaviors like typing speed, mouse movement, and page navigation.
2. Developed responses to suspicious activity, such as CAPTCHA challenges and account locks.
3. Integrated the system with Firebase for data storage.

## Final Result
