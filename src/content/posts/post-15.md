**Leaderboarded** was a capstone project for **COMP 3450 (Human-Computer Interaction Design)**, aimed at creating a **Letterboxd-style platform for video games**. The primary goal was to solve the lack of meaningful user-driven reviews by combining detailed, aspect-specific ratings (Gameplay, Story, Graphics) with social networking features.

## Core HCI, UX, and Technical Implementation

1.  **Iterative UX Design**: The development followed a rigorous design process, focusing on **usability goals** (e.g., efficient to use, easy to learn) and **UX goals** (e.g., rewarding, engaging). Design decisions, such as refining the follow/unfollow button and improving dropdown behavior, were directly based on early user feedback.
2.  **Usability Evaluation and Metrics**: Conducted a formal pilot study to assess **three core tasks** (Find Content/Reviewer, Follow a User, Edit/Post a Review). Data was collected using both **quantitative metrics** (success rates, task completion time observation) and **qualitative data** (user satisfaction via Google Form).
3.  **Key Findings & Iteration**: The evaluation revealed areas for improvement, such as the visual appeal (mean score of 4.15) , which was noted to need more engaging color schemes and better layout. Other issues included confusion in navigation and a low likelihood of recommendation from some users.
4.  **Technical Stack**: The platform was designed using **React** for the frontend for strong community support and **Firebase/Firestore** for the backend/NoSQL database, enabling secure **Google Authentication** and easy data storage. Game information was planned to be pulled from the **IGDB API**.

## Final Result

Leaderboarded successfully demonstrated advanced skills in **HCI methodologies**, moving from concept and user research to a high-fidelity, validated prototype. The project showcases the ability to use data-driven feedback loops to refine a **React-based social web application**.
