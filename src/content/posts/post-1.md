For COMP 2680 Web Site Design & Development, I created a fairly basic website that could be used to show off the full range of Cobramode Minis.

## What I Did

1. **Created Several Templates**: Since this was a Catalog I created several template pages for each months release and a template for each item with an additional one for niche cases.

2. **Collected Cobramode Information**: I then went and collected all the images & text I would need to create the website.

3. **Load Template With Collected Information**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Final Result

You can view the results here, and the repository <a href="https://github.com/DarthPackman/CobraCatalog" target="_blank">here.</a>. Just try to keep in mind I havent updated it since I handed it in.
