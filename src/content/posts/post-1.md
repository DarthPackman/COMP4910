**CobraCatalog** was developed for the **COMP 2680 (Web Site Design & Development)** course to create a navigable hub for Cobramode miniatures. The core motivation was to **intertwine the model visuals with their narrative lore** (the *CobraCompendium*). This project required the efficient creation of a **large-scale web architecture**, culminating in approximately 146 distinct HTML pages.

## Core Technical Implementation

1. **Large-Scale Content Templating**: Successfully developed a system using **HTML templates** (for months and individual items) to efficiently generate and manage the extensive project scope of **around 120 item pages** and **20 month pages**. This process ensured structural consistency across all 146 documents.
2. **Interactive Elements with JavaScript**: Implemented **JavaScript** specifically to drive the **image carousel/slideshow** on the Homepage, providing a dynamic way to showcase recent monthly releases and draw users deeper into the catalog.
3. **Responsive Web Design**: Structured the site using **6 CSS Stylesheets** and responsive design principles, ensuring the detailed catalog views, including item turnaround images and monthly collections, scaled correctly for different screen sizes.
4. **Narrative Integration**: Designed dedicated item pages that feature large turnaround images alongside text blurbs containing the miniatureâ€™s lore, bridging the gap between artistic and narrative values.

## Final Result

The final **CobraCatalog** demonstrated proficiency in managing large web projects from the ground up, highlighting strong skills in template development, responsive design, and integrating custom JavaScript functionality for enhanced user experience.
