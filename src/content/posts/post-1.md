[cite_start]**CobraCatalog** was developed for the **COMP 2680 (Web Site Design & Development)** course to create a navigable hub for Cobramode miniatures[cite: 133]. [cite_start]The core motivation was to **intertwine the model visuals with their narrative lore** (the *CobraCompendium*)[cite: 149, 150]. [cite_start]This project required the efficient creation of a **large-scale web architecture**, culminating in approximately 146 distinct HTML pages[cite: 152].

## Core Technical Implementation

1. [cite_start]**Large-Scale Content Templating**: Successfully developed a system using **HTML templates** (for months and individual items) to efficiently generate and manage the extensive project scope of **around 120 item pages** and **20 month pages**[cite: 155, 156]. [cite_start]This process ensured structural consistency across all 146 documents[cite: 152].
2. [cite_start]**Interactive Elements with JavaScript**: Implemented **JavaScript** specifically to drive the **image carousel/slideshow** on the Homepage, providing a dynamic way to showcase recent monthly releases and draw users deeper into the catalog[cite: 135].
3. [cite_start]**Responsive Web Design**: Structured the site using **6 CSS Stylesheets** [cite: 158] [cite_start]and responsive design principles, ensuring the detailed catalog views, including item turnaround images and monthly collections, scaled correctly for different screen sizes[cite: 55, 160].
4. [cite_start]**Narrative Integration**: Designed dedicated item pages that feature large turnaround images alongside text blurbs containing the miniatureâ€™s lore, bridging the gap between artistic and narrative values[cite: 142].

## Final Result

The final **CobraCatalog** demonstrated proficiency in managing large web projects from the ground up, highlighting strong skills in template development, responsive design, and integrating custom JavaScript functionality for enhanced user experience.
