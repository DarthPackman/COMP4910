**InFaeStation** is a 2.5D action-adventure game where players battle fae creatures to save their dying forest.

## What I Did

1. Created combat mechanics involving root-limb attacks and enemy knockbacks.
2. Designed levels and enemy behaviors.
3. Added a progression system with upgrades collected from leaf sprites.

## Final Result

You can play the game on [Itch.io](https://darthpackman.itch.io/infaestation).
