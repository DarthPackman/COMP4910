**InFaeStation** is a 2.5D action-adventure game developed during a Game Jam, focused on fast-paced combat and environmental storytelling. As a small rootling, the player battles to reclaim their dying forest from malicious fae creatures, requiring hyper-efficient development and a high-fidelity combat loop.

## Core Technical & Combat Implementation

1.  **Pure Melee Combat System**: Implemented a responsive, entirely **melee-based combat system** using **root-limb attacks** and **enemy knockback logic** to give weight and tactical feel to encounters.
2.  **Advanced Parry Mechanic**: Designed and programmed a key defensive feature: a **parry mechanic** capable of catching incoming ranged enemy projectiles and **sending them back** to the sender. This adds a critical skill-based layer to ranged combat encounters.
3.  **Dynamic Progression System**: Developed a functional **progression system** where upgrades collected from **leaf sprites** dynamically alter multiple character attributes:
    * **Combat Stats**: Player damage and attack speed.
    * **Mobility**: Base speed, dash cooldown, and dash distance.
4.  **Artistic Execution**: Utilized the charming and effective pixel art style provided by Elthan's assets (Patreon) to quickly establish the visual mood and atmosphere of the fae-infested world.

## Final Result

This project successfully delivered a compelling proof-of-concept for a combat-heavy action-adventure game, showcasing my ability to implement complex player mechanics and progression systems under tight time constraints.

**Diggy Worm** was a personal project created purely for educational purposes. The goal was to build a low-scope, functional game from scratch to master the core engine, scripting principles, and physics interactions in **Unity**. It serves as an example of deliberate practice in foundational game development.
