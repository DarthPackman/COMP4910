For COMP 4980, I created a multiplayer IoT game featuring mini-games inspired by **Keep Talking & Nobody Explodes**.

## What I Did

1. Designed and implemented eight unique mini-games using the Arduino MKR IoT Carrier.
2. Programmed a master timer and scoring system to manage game sessions.
3. Tested for multiplayer functionality and device responsiveness.

## Final Result
