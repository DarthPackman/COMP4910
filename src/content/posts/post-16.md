The **Content-Based Game Recommendation System** was a major project for **COMP 4610 (Advanced Database Systems)** that focused on applying data mining and analytic techniques to solve the problem of game discovery in a saturated market. Unlike collaborative filtering, this system generates **personalized recommendations** by analyzing **content features** of games, such as themes, mechanics, and textual descriptions.

## Advanced Data Mining and Algorithm Implementation

1.  **Feature Extraction and Data Preprocessing**: Led data cleaning and preprocessing for a complex dataset of Amazon video game reviews. This involved careful handling of missing numerical values (using mean/median) and categorical data (replacing with 'Unknown').
2.  **Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)**: Implemented the **Apriori algorithm** (from the MLxtend library) to identify non-obvious relationships between games based on user purchase/review patterns. This involved carefully tuning parameters like **minimum support**, **minimum confidence**, and **lift** to ensure statistically significant and meaningful recommendations.
3.  **Recommendation Logic**: The system generates **association rules** (e.g., users who play 'Game A' are 75% likely to also engage with 'Game B') with high **lift** values to target niche customer segments. **Confidence** metrics are balanced to ensure recommendation reliability.
4.  **Data Transformation**: Converted user-game interactions into a **transactional dataset** and created a binary matrix suitable for machine readability and efficient pattern detection.

## Final Result and Impact

This project successfully demonstrated the power of **content-based filtering** as a viable alternative to collaborative methods. It showcased expertise in advanced data retrieval and transformation, validating how complex data mining techniques can be leveraged to deliver commercial value through enhanced user engagement and game discovery.
