[cite_start]The **Content-Based Game Recommendation System** was a major project for **COMP 4610 (Advanced Database Systems)** that focused on applying data mining and analytic techniques to solve the problem of game discovery in a saturated market[cite: 2432, 2445, 3084]. [cite_start]Unlike collaborative filtering, this system generates **personalized recommendations** by analyzing **content features** of games, such as themes, mechanics, and textual descriptions[cite: 2433, 2443, 3083, 3106].

## Advanced Data Mining and Algorithm Implementation

1.  [cite_start]**Feature Extraction and Data Preprocessing**: Led data cleaning and preprocessing for a complex dataset of Amazon video game reviews[cite: 3118, 3134, 3177]. [cite_start]This involved careful handling of missing numerical values (using mean/median) and categorical data (replacing with 'Unknown')[cite: 2464, 2465, 3142, 3143].
2.  [cite_start]**Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)**: Implemented the **Apriori algorithm** (from the MLxtend library) to identify non-obvious relationships between games based on user purchase/review patterns[cite: 3087, 3128, 3147]. [cite_start]This involved carefully tuning parameters like **minimum support**, **minimum confidence**, and **lift** to ensure statistically significant and meaningful recommendations[cite: 3129, 3149, 3150, 3151].
3.  [cite_start]**Recommendation Logic**: The system generates **association rules** (e.g., users who play 'Game A' are 75% likely to also engage with 'Game B') with high **lift** values to target niche customer segments[cite: 3152, 3162]. [cite_start]**Confidence** metrics are balanced to ensure recommendation reliability[cite: 3159].
4.  [cite_start]**Data Transformation**: Converted user-game interactions into a **transactional dataset** and created a binary matrix suitable for machine readability and efficient pattern detection[cite: 3145, 3146].

## Final Result and Impact

[cite_start]This project successfully demonstrated the power of **content-based filtering** as a viable alternative to collaborative methods[cite: 2446, 3110]. [cite_start]It showcased expertise in advanced data retrieval and transformation, validating how complex data mining techniques can be leveraged to deliver commercial value through enhanced user engagement and game discovery[cite: 2437, 2444].
