**Artfight 2025** was a highly creative, month-long solo development project, built using the **Godot Engine** and **GDScript**. The goal was to continuously create and integrate pixel art characters submitted by other players during the Artfight event, turning the game into a dynamic, community-driven portfolio piece.

## Core Technical & Art Pipeline

1.  **Unique Technology Stack**: Developed the entire project using **Godot** and **GDScript**, successfully managing a physics-based, 2D infinite runner entirely outside of the Unity ecosystem.
2.  **Semi-Procedural Generation**: Implemented a **randomization system** for obstacle placement within the cave environment, following the **"Fossil vs. Crystal"** theme. The system dynamically increased **obstacle spawn rate** over time to ramp up difficulty and challenge the player's timing.
3.  **Massive Asset Integration**: The core feature development throughout July was the creation and successful implementation of **over 70 unique character assets**. This showcased a robust pipeline for quickly converting external art into game-ready, animated sprites.
4.  **Gameplay Loop**: The runner game requires players to manage timing and precision to jump over crystal obstacles while progressing through the cave environment.

## Final Result & Dedication

Artfight 2025 stands as an exceptional example of sustained creative development and technical execution. It demonstrates proficiency in a secondary game engine (Godot) and the discipline required to maintain a continuous content pipeline over an extended period.
