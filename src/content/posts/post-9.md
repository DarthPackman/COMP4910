**Torn Threads** evolved from a narrative concept into a focused technical showcase for **COMP 1810 (Game Design & Development 1)**. The final prototype effectively demonstrated the implementation of core **First-Person Shooter (FPS)** systems and advanced player movement mechanics across three distinct technical environments.

## Core Technical Implementation

1.  **Modular Level Design**: Implemented a **multi-environment system** consisting of one main map and three distinct mini-game courses to test various mechanics.
2.  **Specialized Mini-Game Design**: Successfully created and implemented two key specialized mini-games to demonstrate diverse mechanical capabilities:
    * **Themed Firing Range**: Developed a functional **firing range** using the *plushie* aesthetic, complete with targeting systems and scoring for weapon accuracy.
    * **Space Grappling Course**: Designed and prototyped an advanced **physics-based traversal course** featuring a functional **grappling hook** mechanic to navigate a complex *sci-fi* environment.
3.  **Core FPS Mechanics (Unity/C#)**: Focused on establishing foundational FPS systems, ensuring responsive player movement, camera control, and weapon handling within the Unity engine.
4.  **Thematic Separation**: Maintained the core thematic distinction by using the *plushie* aesthetic for one mini-game and the *sci-fi* aesthetic for the grappling hook course, proving adaptability across distinct visual styles.

## Final Result

*Torn Threads* is a successful technical demonstration of **FPS prototyping**, highlighting strong skills in implementing core shooting systems, advanced player abilities (grappling), and modular mini-game development under class constraints.
