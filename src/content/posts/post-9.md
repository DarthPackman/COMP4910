**Torn Threads** is a narrative-driven platformer that combines emotional storytelling with challenging platforming.

## What I Did

1. Wrote an engaging story to drive gameplay.
2. Designed platforming challenges that align with the narrative.
3. Developed mechanics that reflect the theme of mending broken threads.

## Final Result
